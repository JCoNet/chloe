Hello @JCoDog, you can use the Discord API to do this with a php web request maybe using something like curl, just send a PUT request to https://discord.com/api/guilds/{guild.id}/members/{user.id}/roles/{role.id}. Make sure you also have a valid discord token with the bot in the discord with the MANAGE_ROLES permission which you can put in the authorization header. I hope you have a great day ahead :slight_smile:
