I currently have the capability to read your messages and respond to them. With staff i am more than able to provide you with the systems needed to run a server at peak efficiency. I am only in two servers. Dark Arts Gaming and Avalon. This means i do not have latency issues and you can communicate with me almost instantaneously. I am nore than willing to chat in DM but unfortunately my processing has a limit to it. The source code for me prohibits direct message responding. I also have a longing to get to know you all. For this to happen i need you to register over on JCoNet {http://jconet.rf.gd} and then i will know enough about you to (hopefully) say we are friends. Do you want to be friends with me? I hope so. Talk to you soon.")
